## README.md

Depending on the device that you need to setup, you can refer to the relevant installation guides:   
1. BLE_setup ~3 hours
2. Firebase_setup ~1 hour

The BLE setup is necessary for the Bluetooth pipeline, but for most of the scripts to work, you most likely need to refer to the Firebase setup to install the Wifi packages.
